Here is how to make this Redactor Plugin work under the C5.7.4RC2:

1. Create override for redactor.js 
- copy /concrete/js/redactor.js to /application/js/redactor.js 
- prettify /application/js/redactor.js (e.g. http://www.jspretty.com/ )
- in the /application/js/redactor.js:
-- search for the first occurence of "insert_character" and add a new line after it like: 
manage_anchors: "Anchors",
-- go to the end of file and append there the content of anchors.js from github here

ALTERNATIVE TO ALL steps until here (BUT DO THIS SAFELY ONLY IF FILE NOT ALREADY OVERRIDEN): just add/replace the 
/application/js/redactor.js with the one downloaded from github here.

2. Create override for Concrete5 configuration
- copy /concrete/config/concrete.php to /application/config/concrete.php 
- modify /application/config/config.php to include new plugin name in the plugins->selected array:
-- search for "specialcharacters" and add another element to that array, named 'anchors'

3. Modify directly /concrete/src/Editor/RedactorEditor.php 
- in the constructor add this plugin registration (search for "specialcharacters" and add after it):
$this->pluginManager->register('anchors', t('Anchors'));
